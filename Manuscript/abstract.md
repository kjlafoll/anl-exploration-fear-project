Discrete emotions are known to elicit changes in decision-making that can persist over time. Previous research has found that affect biases response time and the perception of evidence in favor of a particular choice, among other key factors of decision-making. However, little is known how affect influences the specific cognitive mechanisms that underlie decision-making. In this experiment, we investigated these mechanisms by fitting a hierarchical reinforcement-learning drift diffusion model to participant choice data. Incidental discrete emotions were manipulated with a writing exercise preceding select choices. We found that discrete emotions modulate decision-making though several mechanisms including rate of learning and evidence accumulation, separation of decision thresholds, and sensitivity. Furthermore, we found that each of the four discrete emotions modulated decision-making differently, contributing to four separate profiles. These findings integrate learning and decision process models to expand on previous research and better our understanding of how emotion influences decision-making.
