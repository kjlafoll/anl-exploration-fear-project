## Introduction

Emotion can dictate whether we approach or withdraw from certain decisions. For example, fear can narrow our attention to thinking about escapes or ways to avoid punishment, whereas desire can drive us toward objects of our appetitive urges. A considerable extent literature exists supporting this affect-as-information phenomenon, the idea that affect can itself provide evidence for an action much like expected utility and cost @Gr

(Greifeneder et al., 2010). This information can also influence the speed at which actions are taken, such as in the case where negative emotion strengthens post-error slowing @Inzlicht2015

(Inzlicht et al., 2015). However, different discrete emotions can have greatly disparate effects. For example, anger, while a negative emotion, can lead to approach behaviors (Carver & Harmon-Jones, 2009).
